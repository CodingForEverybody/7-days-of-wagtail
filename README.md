### How it works
Over the next 7 days we'll go through all the source code in this repo, one day at a time.

Each day I (@KalobTaulien) will send you a new video straight to your inbox.

This time next week you will have a basic Wagtail CMS website running on your computer.

**Note:**
>We will **not** be going into advanced subjects like unit testing, routeable page URLs, or multi-site. If you're looking for more advanced tutorials, please check https://learnwagtail.com/

Enrollment is completely free!

#### Day 1
We'll get a new Wagtail website installed and start editing the home page right away.

#### Day 2
We'll editing the Home Page and add custom fields to start making great use of a content management system.

#### Day 3
We'll create a new Django app with a brand new Wagtail page type. Moving forward we'll use this page to learn new things and experiment with.

#### Day 4
Images are important to make a modern website. During day 4 we'll add a new image to our custom page and make use of Wagtail's built-in thumbnailing feature

#### Day 5
We'll create a standard Django model called Author and "enable" it as a Wagtail snippet. Then we'll allow our custom page to choose this Author in an intuitive and user-friendly way.

#### Day 6
A StreamField is how we can add custom content to a page and mix-and-match it so every page can be a little bit different. This is a core Wagtail principle we'll tackle during day 6 of 7 days of Wagtail

#### Day 7
The last thing we'll tackle are global site settings. And in day 7 we'll add a global Instagram link to the footer of ALL our web pages.
